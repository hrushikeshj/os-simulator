<h2><u>MULTIPROGRAMMING WITH A VARIABLE NUMBER OF TASKS</u></h2>
</center>
<p>MVT (Multiprogramming with a Variable number of Tasks) is the other memory management 
technique in which each process gets allocated to the partition according to the amount of memory it needs. That is, the partitioning 
of memory is dynamic and changes as processes enter and leave the system. MVT is a more efficient
user of resources.Initially ram is empty and partitions are made during the run-time according to process’s need instead of partitioning
during system configure.</p>
 
<p>The size of partition will be equal to incoming process.
The partition size varies according to the need of the process so that the internal fragmentation can be avoided to ensure efficient 
utilisation of ram.
Number of partitions in ram is not fixed and depends on the number of incoming process and Main Memory’s size.</p>

<p>For example, suppose in above example- process P1(5MB) and process P3(3MB) completed their execution. 
Hence two spaces are left i.e. 5MB and 3MB. Let’s suppose process P5 of size 8MB comes. The empty space
in memory cannot be allocated as no spanning is allowed in contiguous allocation. The rule says that 
process must be contiguously present in main memory to get executed. Hence it results in External 
Fragmentation.
Now P5 of size 8 MB cannot be accommodated in spite of required available space because in contiguous
nospanning is allowed.</p>
<h2><u>ADVANTAGES</u></h2>
<h3>1.No Internal Fragmentation:</h3>
<p>In variable Partitioning, space in main memory is allocated strictly according to the need of process, 
hence there is no case of internal fragmentation. There will be no unused space left in the partition.</p>
<h3>2.No restriction on Degree of Multiprogramming:</h3>
<p>More number of processes can be accommodated due to absence of internal fragmentation. A process can be 
loaded until the memory is empty.</p>
<h3>3.No Limitation on the size of the process:</h3>
<p>In Fixed partitioning, the process with the size greater than the size of the largest partition could not
be loaded and process can not be divided as it is invalid in contiguous allocation technique. Here, In
variable partitioning, the process size can’t be restricted since the partition size is decided 
according to the process size.</p>
<h2><u>DISADVANTAGES</u></h2>
<h3>1.Difficult Implementation:</h3>
<p>Implementing variable Partitioning is difficult as compared to Fixed Partitioning as it involves 
allocation of memory during run-time rather than during system configure.</p>
<h3>2.External Fragmentation:</h3>
<p>There will be external fragmentation inspite of absence of internal fragmentation.</p>
