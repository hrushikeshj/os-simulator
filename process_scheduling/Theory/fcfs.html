    <h2><u>FIRST COME FIRST SERVE (FCFS)</u></h2>
</center>
        <p>First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests 
            and processes in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, 
            processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. This is managed with a FIFO queue.<br><br>
Completion Time: Time at which process completes its execution.<br>
Turn Around Time: Time Difference between completion time and arrival time.<br> Turn Around Time = Completion Time – Arrival Time<br>
Waiting Time(W.T): Time Difference between turn around time and burst time. <br>
Waiting Time = Turn Around Time – Burst Time<br><br>
<u>EXAMPLE:</u><br>
In the following example, we have 4 processes with process ID P0, P1, P2, and P3. The arrival time of P0 is 0, P1 is 1, P2 is 2, 
and P3 is 3. The arrival time and burst time of the processes are given in the following table.

    <img src="img2.png" alt="FCFS" width="600" height="122"><br><br>
  
    <p>Average Waiting Time = 0+5+12+21/4<br>

                         = 38/4<br>

                         = 9.5 ms<br>

Average Turnaround Time = 6+13+22+33/4<br>

                         =74/4<br>

                         = 18.5 ms<br></p>
                        </center>
<h3><u>ADVANTAGES</u></h3>
<p>1.The simplest form of a CPU scheduling algorithm<br>
2.Easy to program<br>
3.First come first served<br></p>

<h3><u>DISADVANTAGES</u></h3>
<p>1.It is a Non-Preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm, so after the process has been allocated to the CPU, it will never release the CPU until it finishes executing.<br>
2.The Average Waiting Time is high.<br>
3.Short processes that are at the back of the queue have to wait for the long process at the front to finish.<br>
4.Not an ideal technique for time-sharing systems.<br>
5.Because of its simplicity, FCFS is not very efficient.</p>
