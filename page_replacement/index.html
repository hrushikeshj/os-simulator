            In a operating systems that use paging for memory management, page replacement algorithm 
            are needed to decide which page needed to be replaced when new page comes in. Whenever 
            a new page is referred and not present in memory, page fault occurs and Operating System 
            replaces one of the existing pages with newly needed page. Different page replacement 
            algorithms suggest different ways to decide which page to replace. The target for all 
            algorithms is to reduce number of page faults.<br>
            Page Fault - A page fault is a type of interrupt, raised by the hardware when a running 
            program accesses a memory page that is mapped into the virtual address space, but not 
            loaded in physical memory.

                The simplest page-replacement algorithm is a FIFO algorithm. The first-in, first-out 
                (FIFO) page replacement algorithm is a low-overhead algorithm that requires little 
                bookkeeping on the part of the operating system. The idea is obvious from the name -
                the operating system keeps track of all the pages in memory in a queue, with the 
                most recent arrival at the back, and the oldest arrival in front. When a page needs
                to be replaced, the page at the front of the queue (the oldest page) is selected.
                While FIFO is cheap and intuitive, it performs poorly in practical application. 
                Thus, it is rarely used in its unmodified form. This algorithm experiences Bélády's
                anomaly. In simple words, on a page fault, the frame that has been in memory the 
                longest is replaced.

                The least recently used (LRU) page replacement algorithm keeps track of page usage
                 over a short period of time. LRU works on the idea that pages that have been 
                 most heavily used in the past few instructions are most likely to be used 
                 heavily in the next few instructions too. While LRU can provide near-optimal 
                 performance in theory (almost as good as adaptive replacement cache), 
                 it is rather expensive to implement in practice. 
                 There are a few implementation methods for this algorithm that try to 
                 reduce the cost yet keep as much of the performance as possible.

                In this algorithm, pages are replaced which are not used for the longest duration of time in the future.
                This algorithm cannot be implemented in a general purpose operating system because 
                it is impossible to compute reliably how long it will be before a page is going to 
                be used, except when all software that will run on a system is either known 
                beforehand and is amenable to static analysis of its memory reference patterns, 
                or only a class of applications allowing run-time analysis.

            <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 fs-5">
                The not frequently used (NFU) page replacement algorithm requires a counter, 
                and every page has one counter of its own which is initially set to 0. 
                At each clock interval, all pages that have been referenced within that 
                interval will have their counter incremented by 1. In effect, the counters 
                keep track of how frequently a page has been used. Thus, the page with the 
                lowest counter can be swapped out when necessary.<br>
                The main problem with NFU is that it keeps track of the frequency of use without 
                regard to the time span of use. Thus, in a multi-pass compiler, pages which were 
                heavily used during the first pass, but are not needed in the second pass will be 
                favoured over pages which are comparably lightly used in the second pass, as they 
                have higher frequency counters.
