        In a operating systems that use paging for memory management, page replacement algorithm 
        are needed to decide which page needed to be replaced when new page comes in. Whenever 
        a new page is referred and not present in memory, page fault occurs and Operating System 
        replaces one of the existing pages with newly needed page. Different page replacement 
        algorithms suggest different ways to decide which page to replace. The target for all 
        algorithms is to reduce number of page faults.
        Page Fault - A page fault is a type of interrupt, raised by the hardware when a running 
        program accesses a memory page that is mapped into the virtual address space, but not 
        loaded in physical memory.
